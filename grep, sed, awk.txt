sed is stream editor which search the word in file 

sed -e 's/searchword/replaceword/' filename.txt > filenew.txt-> output to filenew.txt, -e-expreson
sed -i 's/searchword/replaceword/' filename.txt-> -i writes on same file.
sed -i 's/searchword/replaceword/g' filename.txt-> globally search replace

cat /etc/passwd->shows password
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
user column: x-path to passwd file, 0:user id,0:group id,root:additional details,/root:home directory, /bin/bash 

to cut out first column
cut -  to findout column
cut -d ":" -f1 /etc/passwd-> -d delimiter->shows first column
cut -d ":" -f3 /etc/passswd=> user id column
cut -d ":" -f3-4 /etc/passwd -> shows third and fourth column


df -h->shows disk utilization info

df -h | cut -d " " -f4 -> df files are saved through cut but this is not possible because of ununiform space

for this type of cut, we need more advance tool like awk


awk is processing text files, parsing files and generating
reports
df -h  | awk -F " " ' {print $4}'
